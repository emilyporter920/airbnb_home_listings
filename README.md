         >
    </p>

* Listings with less bedrooms have the highest sum price, which insinuates that most booked listings only have 1 bedroom.

<p align="center">
    <img

         >
    </p>

* As expected, listings with more bedrooms have higher average prices than those with less bedrooms.
